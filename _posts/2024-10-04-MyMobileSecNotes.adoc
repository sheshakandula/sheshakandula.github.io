This is my notes that I use during my Mobile (Android or iOS) Penetration Testing. 
// Here's a quick demo of a few features from https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc^].

//== Including an image

== ADB Commands

These are the few handy commands I use during the Android Testing with device/emulator.

//The code can be included as an inline snippet such as `this`.

//Code blocks are also available:

[source,bash,title=To take screenshots/screenrecord for quick PoC]
----

adb exec-out screencap -p > screenshot.png
adb shell screencap /sdcard/screencap.png
adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/screenrecord.mp4

----

== Start the Activity
With ADB, we can start the exported activity. Below commands help with the syntax. 

[source,bash]
----
adb shell am start -n com.example.app/.ExportedActivity
adb shell am start -n com.example.app/com.example.app.ExportedActivity
----

Explanation: 

* -a intent action like VIEW/SEND
* -n component name like activity name
* -c category intent like LAUNCHER
* -eu extra URI
* -d data URI
* -t mime type

== ADB Over Wi-Fi
For some reasons if you are using Docker container to test the Android apps and your host machine (Mac/Windows) don't have required mobile tools. You can pull a docker image and run the required tools inside the docker container. In such scenarios, connecting the device over USB won't be successful. That may be limitations with Docker. 
In this scenario, we can use ADB Over Wi-Fi.
