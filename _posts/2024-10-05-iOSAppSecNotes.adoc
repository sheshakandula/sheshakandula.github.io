This is my notes that I took during my iOS Application Penetration Testing over the years.
// Here's a quick demo of a few features from https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc^].

== Jailbreaking
With checkm8 hardware jailbreak solution, we can jailbreak the iPhones till iPhone X. But time is running out, as Apple support for the latest version of OS on iPhone X. 
Successor to the checkra1n is palera1n.

=== SSH to Jailbroken device (iPhone X)

* First SSH as Mobile user (ssh as root user is not working anymore and it throws error like UNIX Authentication is not enabled)
    - `ssh mobile@ipaddress-of-iPhone`
* Then run as root user with sudo
    - `sudo -i -u root`

For some reason, SSH is not working means, reinstall `system-cmds, libpam2 and libpam-modules` from Sileo.

In worst case, install NewTerm app on the device and use the terminal on device.

== Few Helpful Commands

Find the path of the application : `ps -ef | grep -i <appname>`

These are regular commands to interact with Android rooted device

While testing to find the newly created or modified files `find . -cmin -5` This gives the files in the last 5 minutes.

== To start the iPhone forcefully
Sometimes during jailbreak if the device become unresponsive and not starting means. 

* Press the "up" volume button and quickly release
* Press the "down" volumen button and quickly release
* Hold in the lock button on the right side of the phone for about 5 seconds (or until the apple logo appears)

== Burp Proxy
Keep the proxy in Settings

* Go to Safari and visit http://burp (on Chrome it didn't work for some reasons)
* First install the burp certificate. Then go to General -> About -> Certificate Trust Settings -> Enable full trust for certificates enable that.
