Here's a quick demo of a few features from https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc^].

== Training : Web Application Penetration Testing

This 3-hour Web Application Penetration Testing training covers key security concepts, tools, and techniques. Participants will learn to identify and exploit vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF through hands-on exercises. The session also includes reporting and mitigations offering essential skills for security professionals, developers, and IT admins.

This Web Application Penetration Testing Training Session provides a hands-on introduction to web application security, focusing on identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities. The session begins with an overview of web application security, highlighting real-world breaches and the OWASP Top 10 threats. Participants will then set up a testing environment and familiarize themselves with essential tools like Burp Suite, SQLMap, and Nmap.

The core of the training covers practical exploitation techniques for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Broken Authentication, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Security Misconfigurations. Each section includes real-world attack scenarios and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

Beyond exploitation, the training emphasizes reporting and mitigation strategies, guiding participants on how to document findings, assess risk severity, and recommend security best practices. The session concludes with a Q&A and wrap-up, ensuring participants leave with actionable knowledge and resources for further skill development.

This training is ideal for security professionals, developers, and IT administrators seeking a foundational understanding of web application penetration testing and secure coding practices.
