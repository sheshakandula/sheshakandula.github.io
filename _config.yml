  bio: AppSec OSWE OSCP CISSP
#  bio: With 15 years of experience in **Application Security**, focusing on **web, mobile**, and **APIs**, I have developed deep expertise in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities, particularly in alignment with the **OWASP Top 10** for both web and mobile security. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience addressing real-world security challenges and hold certifications such as **OSWE**, **OSCP**, and **CISSP**, which further validate my skills. Having benefited significantly from the security community over the years, I now want to give back by publishing a course on **Android Application Security**. This course is designed specifically for beginners, with the aim of helping them build a strong foundation in mobile app security. By sharing my knowledge and practical insights, I hope to empower the next generation of security professionals and foster a more secure mobile ecosystem. # FIXME Replace with your bio.
